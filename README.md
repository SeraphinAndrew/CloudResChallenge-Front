# CloudResChallenge

After years of working in the IT as a field technician, working diligently to create a solid technical foundation to build upon, I thought I'd try my hand at The Cloud Resume Challenge. 

The Cloud Resume Challenge, created and hosted by Forrest Brazeal, is a hands-on project which facilitates learning through doing. For me, studying and passing exams makes for a fun and productive few weeks, but upon completion I'm often left feeling lost about how to approach actual projects. Mr.Brazeal's answer to this dilemma was to design a project which uses some of the most common cloud services to create something tangible for recruiters and hiring managers to see.
This project provides me the opportunity to dive into these resources, troubleshoot my way through errors by means of whitepages and docs, and ultimately realize my goal of thorough understanding while also building my first personal website.

Skills and technologies which I've been exposed to through this project include:
- AWS:
    - IAM
    - S3
    - CloudFront
    - Route 53
    - AMC
- Frontend Dev
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Bootstrap
